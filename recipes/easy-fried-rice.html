    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The ultimate comfort food: A steaming, homemade lasagna, fresh out of the oven. It’s baked to a perfect golden-brown and fills the room with the mouth-watering scent of savory bolognese and herbs. That magical moment when the melted mozzarella stretches into gooey strings promises pure coziness. Garnished with fresh basil—a slice of Italian warmth on a plate.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    
    <h3>The Base</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Cooked Rice: 2–3 cups of cold, day-old rice</li>
        <li>Oil: Vegetable or canola oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Mix-ins</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Eggs: 2–3 large eggs, whisked.</li>
        <li>Vegetables: 1 cup mixed veggies (peas, carrots, corn – frozen mix is fine).</li>
        <li>Aromatics: 2 cloves garlic (minced), 1 small onion or shallot (diced).</li>
        <li>Green Onions: Chopped (separate white and green parts).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Sauce</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Soy Sauce: 2–3 tablespoons (adjust to taste).</li>
        <li>Sesame Oil: 1 teaspoon (to finish).</li>
        <li>Oyster Sauce: 1 tablespoon (optional, adds depth).</li>
        <li>Butter: A small knob (optional, for extra richness like hibachi style).</li>
        <li>Salt & White Pepper: To taste.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    
    <h3>Step 1: Prep work</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Break up the Rice: Take your cold rice and break up any large clumps with your hands or a fork. This ensures each grain fries evenly.</li>
        <li>Whisk Eggs: Beat the eggs in a small bowl with a pinch of salt.</li>
        <li>Chop: Minced garlic, dice onions, and chop green onions.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Step 2: Scramble the Eggs</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a wok or large pan over medium-high heat. Add a drizzle of oil.</li>
        <li>Pour in the eggs and scramble them quickly until just set.</li>
        <li>Remove the eggs from the pan and set them aside on a plate (so they don't overcook).</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Step 3: Sauté Aromatics & Veggies</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add a bit more oil to the hot pan.</li>
        <li>Add the onions and white parts of green onions. Stir-fry for 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Add the garlic and mixed vegetables. Stir-fry for 2–3 minutes until the veggies are tender but crisp.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Step 4: Fry the Rice</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Turn the heat up to high.</li>
        <li>Add the cold rice and the knob of butter (if using).</li>
        <li>Stir-fry constantly for about 3 minutes. You want to toast the rice and heat it through. Tip: Press the rice into the pan to let it get a little crispy, then toss.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Step 5: Season & Combine</h3>
    <ol>
       <li>Pour the soy sauce (and oyster sauce) evenly over the rice. Toss well to coat every grain in brown color.</li>
       <li>Add the cooked eggs back into the pan and break them up into smaller pieces as you mix.</li>
       <li>Season with white pepper and remove from heat.</li>
    </ol>

        <h3>Step 5: Finish</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Stir in the sesame oil.</li>
        <li>Garnish with the fresh green parts of the green onions.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately while piping hot!</li>
    </ol>
