    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The ultimate comfort food: A steaming, homemade lasagna, fresh out of the oven. It’s baked to a perfect golden-brown and fills the room with the mouth-watering scent of savory bolognese and herbs. That magical moment when the melted mozzarella stretches into gooey strings promises pure coziness. Garnished with fresh basil—a slice of Italian warmth on a plate.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    
    <h3>The Meat Sauce (Ragù)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Ground Beef: (Or a mix of beef and pork)</li>
        <li>Olive Oil: For sautéing.</li>
        <li>Aromatics: Onions and garlic (finely chopped).</li>
        <li>Tomatoes: Crushed tomatoes, tomato purée (passata), and tomato paste.</li>
        <li>Herbs: Dried oregano, dried basil, and perhaps a bay leaf.</li>
        <li>Seasoning: Salt, black pepper, and a pinch of sugar (to balance the acidity).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Béchamel (White Sauce)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Butter: Unsalted is usually best.</li>
        <li>All-Purpose Flour: To make the roux.</li>
        <li>Whole Milk: For a creamy texture.</li>
        <li>Nutmeg: A pinch of ground nutmeg (essential for the classic flavor).</li>
        <li>Salt & Pepper.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Assembly & Topping</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Lasagna Sheets: (Egg pasta sheets, either pre-cooked or oven-ready).</li>
        <li>Mozzarella Cheese: Shredded (for the layers) and fresh slices (for the top to get that stringy "cheese pull").</li>
        <li>Parmesan Cheese: Grated (for the savory, golden crust).</li>
        <li>Fresh Basil: Whole leaves for the garnish on top.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    
    <h3>Step 1: Make the Meat Sauce (Ragù)</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the chopped onions and garlic and sauté until soft (about 5 minutes).</li>
        <li>Add the ground beef. Break it up with a spoon and cook until browned. Drain any excess fat if necessary.</li>
        <li>Stir in the tomato paste, crushed tomatoes, and tomato purée.</li>
        <li>Add the herbs (oregano, basil, bay leaf) and season with salt, pepper, and a pinch of sugar.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to low, cover, and let it simmer for at least 20–30 minutes to let the flavors meld.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Step 2: Make the Béchamel Sauce</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Whisk in the flour and cook for 1–2 minutes (do not let it brown) to create a roux.</li>
        <li>Gradually pour in the milk while whisking constantly to avoid lumps.</li>
        <li>Simmer gently, stirring frequently, until the sauce thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat and stir in the nutmeg, salt, and pepper.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Step 3: Assembly</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>Spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish (this prevents sticking).</li>
        <li>Layer 1: Place lasagna sheets over the sauce. Top with a layer of meat sauce, a drizzle of béchamel, and a sprinkle of grated Parmesan and shredded Mozzarella.</li>
        <li>Repeat Layers: Repeat this process (Pasta -> Meat -> Béchamel -> Cheese) until you fill the dish (usually 3 or 4 layers).</li>
        <li>Top Layer: Finish with a final layer of pasta, cover completely with the remaining béchamel (to keep pasta soft), and top generously with the remaining Mozzarella and Parmesan.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Step 4: Bake</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cover the dish with aluminum foil (tip: spray the foil with oil so the cheese doesn't stick to it).</li>
        <li>Bake for 25 minutes covered.</li>
        <li>Remove the foil and bake for another 15–20 minutes until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Step 5: Rest & Serve</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Important: Let the lasagna rest for 10–15 minutes after taking it out of the oven. This allows the layers to set so it doesn't fall apart when you cut it.</li>
        <li>Garnish with fresh basil leaves just before serving.</li>
    </ol>
